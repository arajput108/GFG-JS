Q1(The IF statement):- Given a number, you have to use the if statement to print "Big" (without quotes) if the given number is greater than 100. 
                      The statement "Number" (without quotes) will be printed regardless.

Example 1:
Input:
number = 10
Output: Number 
Explanation: 10 is definitely not greater
than 100, so we don't print Big

Example 2:
Input:
number = 101
Output: Big
Number
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100,
so we print Big

Your Task: 
Just write an if statement at the mentioned place that prints "Big" if the given number is greater than 100.

Sol:-  class Solution {
    utility(numbers) {
        const results = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            if (numbers[i] > 100) {
                results.push("Big");
            } else {
                results.push("Number");
            }
        }
        console.log(results.join('\n'));
    }
}
 


Q2(The ELSE statement):- Given a number, you have to use the if statement to print "Big" (without quotes) if the given number is greater than 100, and use the else statement to print "Number" (without quotes) when the number is smaller than or equal to 100.
                        Note: You should print the newline after printing"Number" or"Big".
Example 1:
Input:number = 10
Output: Number
Explanation: 10 is definitely smaller thanor equal to 100, so our else statementworks and we print Number.
Example 2:

Input:number = 101
Output:Big
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100, soour if statement works and we print Big.

Your Task:
Just write if-else statements at the mentioned place. Remember if statement prints Big when the number is greater than 100, and the else statement prints Number when the number is smaller than or equal to 100.


Sol:-   class Solution {
    utility(number) {
        // write your if statement here
        if(number > 100){ 
            console.log("Big");
        }
        // write your else statement here
        else {
            console.log("Number");
        }
    }
}


Q3(ELSE-IF statement):- Given a number, you have to use if, else if, else conditional statements according to the following:
if number is greater than 100: Print "Big" (without quotes)
else if number is smaller than 10: Print "Small" (without quotes)
else: Print "Number" (without quotes)


Sol:- class Solution {
    utility(number) {
        // write your if - else if - else statements here
        if(number > 100){
            console.log("Big");
        }
        else if(number < 10){
            console.log("Small");
        }
        else {
            console.log("Number");
        }
    }
}

Q4(Find if +ve, -ve or 0):- You will be given a number A. Your task is to print "Positive" if the number is positive, print "Negative" if 
                           negative and print "Zero" if it is 0.

Example 1:
Input: 
A = 4
Output: Positive

Sol:- class Solution {
    utility(A) {
   
    if (A > 0) {
        console.log("Positive");
    } else if (A < 0) {
        console.log("Negative");
    } else {
        console.log("Zero");
    }
}
}

Q5(Switch statement):-  Given a number, you have to use switch statement to print "One" (without quotes) if the given number is 
                       equal to 1 else print "Not One"(without quotes).

Example 1:
Input:
number = 10
Output: Not One

Example 2:
Input:
number = 1
Output: One

Your Task: 
Just write a switch statement at the mentioned place that prints "One" if the given number is equal to 1 else prints "Not One".

Sol:- class Solution {
    utility(number) {
        // write your switch statement here
        switch(number){
            case 1:
                console.log("One");
                break;
            default:

Q6(FizzBuzz Program):- You are given a number  and you have to print your answer according to the following:
                       If the number is divisible by 3, you print "Fizz" (without quotes)
                       If the number is divisible by 5, you print "Buzz" (without quotes)
                       If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print "FizzBuzz" (without quotes)
                       In any other case, you print the number itself

Example 1:
Input:
number = 3
Output: Fizz
Explanation: Here, the number is divisible
by 3, so Fizz is printed.

Example 2:
Input:
number = 5
Output: Buzz
Explanation: Here the number is divisible
by 5, so Buzz is printed.

Example 3:
Input:
number = 15
Output: FizzBuzz
Explanation: Here, the number 15 is
divisible by both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz
is printed.

Your Task: Complete the function fizzBuzz() which takes an integer as the only input parameter.

        } else {
        console.log(number.toString());
        }
      }
    }
