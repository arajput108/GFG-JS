1.) You are given a string s. You need to find the length of the string.

    Ex 1:
    Input: s = Geeks
    Output: 5

    Ex 2:
    Input: s = Hello1234
    Output: 9
 
    Your Task: You only need to complete the function lengthString() that takes s as parameter and returns 
                the length of the string. 
    Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
    Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

    Constraints: 1 <= | s |  <= 100000

 
Sol:-   class Solution {
                lengthString(str) {
                    let s= " ";
                    let lengthOfs= str.length;
                    return str.length;
                }
            }
        //console.log("Length of the string s:", lengthOfS);


2.) Given a string S and two integers L and R. Print the characters in the range L to R of the string.
    NOTE: Assume zero based indexing.

    Example 1:
    Input: 
    S = "cdbkdub"
    L = 0 , R = 5
    Output: "cdbkdu" 
    Explanation: Starting from index 0 ('c')
    to index 5 ('u').

    Example 2:
    Input: 
    S = "sdiblcsdbud"
    L = 3 , R = 7
    Output: "blcsd"
    Explanation: Starting from index 3 ('b')
    to index 7 ('d').

Your Task: You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function substring() which 
           takes S, L, R as input parameters and returns the string from the range L to R.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

Constraints: 1<= |S| <=1000
             1 <= L <= 800
             1 <= R <= 900
             
Sol:- class Solution {
        substring(str, l, r) {
        return str.substring(l, r + 1);
        }
    }
